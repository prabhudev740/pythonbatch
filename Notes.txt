Python is High level Language and interpreted Language

It is developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

Why Python or Advantages of Python
-------------------------------------
1) free and opernsource
2) It is easy t learn: bcz its english like Syntax
3) Its interpreted lang. incase we get any error it will point to that perticular line
4) It will take less lines of code for same funcionality, redunce in devopment time
5) more then 1.5 lakn packages and more than 7 core modules
6) Its portable
7) Dynamic progamming language


Uses of Python
----------------
develop desktop, mobile application
game devopment
web development
networking
Data Science
Automation
AI/ ML/ Dl /Big Data
Shell Scripting

Keywords
-----------
These are reseved words, to perform prerticular task

there are 35 Keywords till Python 3.7

False               class               from                or
None                continue            global              pass
True                def                 if                  raise
and                 del                 import              return
as                  elif                in                  try
assert              else                is                  while
async               except              lambda              with
await               finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not

Variable
--------------
var = value
identifier = value

Identifiers
-------------
these are the names which are used to identify the variables, fumctions, classes, objects, etc

There are set of rules to define a varible name/ identifier
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) variable names are case sensitive
2) can't use Keywords
3) can't special char except _
4) can't use space at first or middle
5) varible should not start with numbers (we can give number at middle or at the end)
6) it can be of any length but it should be meaningful


variables
------------
Variables are reseved memory locations, where we can some data/ values
To define a variable we have to take help of Identifiers
when we create a varible, it reseve some memory space
all the values will stored Heap memory and adress of varible stored in stack memory

Syntax : var = value
x = 10
name = "abc"
is_valid = True

is_valid = False
x = 20
name = "xyz

Data Types
---------------
These are the types of data stored inside variables

These are of 2 types
--------------------
1) Single Valued Data types
2) Collection Data Types

                    Data types
                /               \
        Single Valued DT          collection DT
        /               \          -----------------
    Numeric         Boolean         string ("Prabhu", 'name', '10')
    -----------     ---------       list ([1, 2, 3])
    int (10, -1)    True            tuples ((1, 2, 3))
    float (10.5)    False           set ({1, 2, 3})
    complex (2+3j)                  dict ({key: value, key2: value2})


type() : it is used to check type of variable

integer
-------
all the positive and negetive whole numbers without decimal points.
represented as "int"

Ex : 10, 0, -100, -5000, 276

Default value -> 0
int() : is used check the default value of integer

float
---------
it is a positive or negetive number with decimal point
represented as "float"

Ex: 10.55, -500.0, -0.67, 0.0

default value -> 0.0
float() : used to check default value of float

complex
-----------
complex = real + imag

it is combinamtion real and imag no.s
format : a + bj // if we write J it will internally converted to 'j'

a => real part => a can int or float
b => imag part => int or float

represented as 'complex'

Ex : 1 + 5j, 5j, 5.0 + 11.4j

Default value : 0j
complex() : to check default value

value of j = Square root of -1


Boolean
--------------
In python Boolean are 2 Keywords \. i.e True , False
represented "bool"

Ex : True, False

Default value : False
bool() : to check default value of Boolean


string
----------
strings are collection data type enclose, ' ', " ", ''' ''', """ """

we cam  n n.o  char inside string

"A -Z", "a -z", "0-9", Special char  ex - ][, _ - +

represented as "str"

default value => ''

str()  -> to check default value


memory allocation
----------------------
Whenever controller see a collection data type, it will create memory layer
then it check the lengh of that collection / string , len = n
it crate n block of memoty inside that layer
It will store all values one by one respectively
Then it give index values
Give adress to that objext
var will refer to that objet

Strings are immutable
it has indexing, its ordered data types ,

s = "1234" , len = 4
    0   1   2   3
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | ----> 0x55
-4    -3   -2   -1

s -> 0x55


indexing  or subadressing
---------------------------
tere are two types of indexing
1) +ve (0 -> len(collection) - 1)
2) -ve (-1 to -len(collection))

Syntx of accessing a value from string
varname[index]

as its immutable we can't replace or assign a value from string
var[idex] = new_val

len() => chexck the len of collection

list
-------
this is a collection of hemog..  of heterg data Types

we can store n  no. of values inside a list
These are ordered statypes, so these have indexing
These are mutable datatypes
these are enclose within []
these are comma (,) separated values
represented as 'list'

Sytax : var = [val1, val2, vl3......valn]
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]


default value => []
list() =. t check default
len(list) => to ceck length

memory allocation
--------------------
It will create memory layer in heap memory
it will check len list
It will divide that memory layer into len of blocks
It will store vales one by one respectively
It give index value
Assign some adress to that objects
varible in stack will refer to that address


tuples
------------
Tuple is collection data type of homogeous ans heterogenous.
It is immutable
Its a oredered data type
All the data stored inside (), separated by comma (,)
represented as 'tuple'
It is more secure than list.

Syntax : var = (val1, val2, val3, .... val n)
ex : x = (1, 2, 3)

default value : ()
tuple() => to check default value
len() => to check len 


set
------
Set is a collection datatypes, homogeous and heterogenous datatypes
We can store n no of value, but it doesm't allow duplicate valuws
all the values are enclosed within {}
All values will be separated by comma
It is am unorederd data type, so it doesn;t support indexing
All the data in set stored randomly or shuffled manner

represented as 'set'

Syntax : var = {val1, val2, ...val n}
x = {1, 2, 3, 4}

default val => set()
set() => check default val
len() => check len

memory manangmt
--------------
It will create memory layer in heap memory.
It check the length of set, divide that memory into that muh parts
It will store all the randomly
it will some address
in stack memory var will point to the address


Dictionary
-------------
This is a collection DT with Key, Value pair
To assign any value for any key we use colon (:)
all key value pairs will be separated by ,
enclosed within {}
Key can't be duplicated but we can store duplicate values
Dictionary is mutable :- update, add, remove, etc operations can be does
It is unorederd DT
keys are case sensitive
keys must be immutable or single values Data Types, we can't write set and list as dict key
 and value can be of both mutable and immutabe

 controller can only access to keys

 represented as dict

 Synatx : var = {key1:val1, key2:val2, ...., key n : val n}
 ex : - x = {1 : True, False : "No", 0j : [1, 2, 3], 10.5 : (1, 2, 3), "name' : "Msys", "Name: True}

 To acces a value : var[key]
 ex : x[1] --> True
 x[0j]  --> [1, 2, 3]

 To update value of key ->  var[key] = new val
 to to add new key value pair : var[new_key] = new_val

 default value --> {}
 dict() -> to check default value
 len() -> to check no of elements


memory manangmt
==================
when our controller sees a dict. DT it will create a dict block with key and val in Heap memory
first it will store all the leys
then it will store values one by one
then assign some address to that dict block
in stack memory var will point to that address



Slicing
-------------
Its a way of extracting required set of elements from a given collection
we use indexing to perform Slicing
can be performed on ordered DT -> string, list, tuple

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Syntax : var[start_index: end_index +/- 1: updation/step< optional >]

they are of two types
    +ve update
    -ve update

+ve updation
-------------
When we want to fetch value from left to right we use +ve updation
    start_index < end_index

    Syntax; var[start_index:end_index + 1:step/updation]

default start_index = 0
default end_index = len(collection)
default updation = +1

we use step or updation skip character from give collection

-ve updation
----------------
we fetch value from right to left
    start_index > end_index

Syntax : var[start_index: end_index -1: stpe]

default start_index = > -1
default end_index => -len(collection) -1
step => -1

Default values
---------------
DT          func        val
-----       -----       ------
integer     int()       0
float       float()     0.0
complex     complex()   0j
Boolean     bool()      False
string      str()       ""
list        list()      []
tuple       tuple()     ()
set         set()       set()
dict        dict()      {}


Types Casting
---------------
To converting one DT another DT

Source DT               ------->                        converted DT
--------------                                         -----------------
float, bool, str(only integer value)            --->                int
int, bool, str(only int or float value)         --->                float
int, float, bool, str (all numeric DT int, float, complex) -->      complex
any DT (default will return False, else True)   --->                bool
any DT                                          --->                str
str, tuple, set, dict (list of keys only)       --->                list
str, list, set, dict (list of keys only)        --->                tuple
str, list, tuple, dict (list of keys only)      --->                set
nested data types (with 2 values)               --->                dict

ex: ([1, 2], ["a", "b"])
[{1, 2}, [3, 4], (1, 2)]


Operators
-----------------
These are special symbols used to perform specific task.

Syntax : val 1 (Operator) val 2
val 1 and val 2 are called operands


There are 7 types of Operators
==============================
Arithmatic Op.
logical  Op.
Relational op.
Assignment Op.
Bitwise Op.
Membership Op.
Identity Op.

Arithmatic Op.
-------------------
These are used for Arithmatic operations

a) addition         --> +
b) substraction     --> -
c) multiplication   --> * 
d) true division    --> /
e) floor division   --> //
g) modulus          --> %
h) power            --> **

    a) addition / concatenation --> +
        Synatx : val1 + val2

        svdt + svdt  ---> addition
        collection + collection ---> concatenation

        * collections must be of same type (only str, list, tuple)

    b) substraction -> -
        Synatx : val1 - val2

        svdt - svdt

        this is applicable to svdt only

    c) multiplication -> *
        Synatx : val1 * val2

        svdt * svdt
        collection * int

        * we can multiply collection (str, list, tuple only) with only int

    d) tru division --> /
        Synatx : val1 / val2

        return the result in float value

    e) floor division  --> //
        Synatx : val 1 // val 2

        return the result in int value

    f) modulus --> %
        it return reminder

        Syntax : val 1 % val2

    g) pow --> **
        it return pow of val 1 with respect to val 2

        Synatx : val 1 ** val 2

Logical Op.
---------------
Logical and 
Logical or 
logical not 

Falsy Values => all the default values (0, 0.0, 0j, False, "", [], (), set(), {})
Truthy Values => all values except default values are Truthy values


Relational Op.
----------------
It will return Boolean value ( True or False)
1) equal to (==)
2) not equal to (!=)
3) less than (<)
4) greater then (>)
5) less than or equal to(<=)
6) greater then or equal to(>=)

    1) equal to 
    ----------------
    It will check both values are same or not
    If both values are equal it will return True, else it will return False
    It will check all the values using their ASCII val

    val 1 == val 2,  10 == 5 -> False and 5 == 5 -> True

    2) not equal to ( != )
    ----------------------
    It will check both values are same or not
    If both values are same, it will return False, else it will return True

    Syntax : val 1 != val 2, 
            10 != 20 -> True
            "" != " " -> True
            5 != 5 -> False

    
    3) less than (<)
    -------------------
    It will check if the val 1 is less then val 2.
    if val 1 is < val 2 , return True, else False

    for svdt it will check bpoth the values compare then, return the res. ( except complex value)

    for collection, it will compare their length
                    it will elements 1 by one , if condition satisfied then true, else False

    4) greater then ( > )
    -----------------------
    if the val  1 is > val 2
    if val 1 > val 2, it will return True, else False

    5) less than or equal to(<=)
    ---------------------------------
     It will check if the val 1 is less then  or wqual to val 2 or not
    if val 1 is <= val 2 , return True, else False

    6) greater then or equal to(>=)
    ---------------------------------------
    if the val  1 is >= val 2
    if val 1 >= val 2, it will return True, else False

Assignment Op.
-------------
var = val

1) a = 10
2) a += 5 ---> a = a+ 5
3) a -= 10 ---> a = a- 10
4) a *= 10 ---> a = a* 10
5) a /= 10  ---> a = a / 10
6) a //= 10 ---> a = a// 10
7) a %= 10   ---> a = a % 10
8) a **= 10  --> a = a ** 10


5) Bitwise Op.
---------------------
    a) Bitwise and ( & )
    b) Bitwise or ( | )
    c) Bitwise not ( ~ )
    d) Bitwise xor ( ^ )
    e) Bitwise right shift ( >> )
    e) Bitwise left shift ( << )

    a) Bitwise and ( & )
    ----------------------
    Syntax : val1 & val2
    it will both val to its binary form
    controller will stact computation from right to left
    if both the values are 1 it will be 1, else 0

    b) Bitwise or ( | )
    --------------------
    Syntax : val1 | val2

    it will convert to binary form
    controller will start combinamtion from right to left
    if atleast 1 val is 1, it will be 1, else 0
    it will return the valu as int

    c) Bitwise not ( ~ )
    ---------------------
    Syntax : ~ val

    controller will convert the val into binary
    controller will start computation frm right to left

    if +ve numbers
    ------------
    it will invert the values one by one from right to left untill it found first 0
    it will invert the 0 also
    the remaing values are taken as it is
    it will return the val in int format as -ve


    if -ve numbers
    -----------------
    it will invert the values one by one from right to left untill it found first 1
    it will invert the 1 also
    the remaing values are taken as it is
    it will return the val in int format as +ve

    d) xor ( ^ )
    --------------
    Syntax : val1 ^ val2

    it will convert to binary form
    controller will start computation from right to left
    if aif both the values are equal it gives 0, else 1
    it will return the valu as int
    
    e) Bitwise right shift ( >> )
    -------------------------------
        +ve number
        ---------
        shifts the number to right and filled with 0 in void

        -ve number
        -------------
        shifts the number to right and fill with 1 in void
    f) Bitwise left shift ( << )
    ---------------------------
    it will shift the to left 
    fill 0 in void wheather its +ve number or -ve number


6) Membership Op.
--------------------
for mebership op. we use in and not in
return type 'bool'
in
----
Syntax :
     val in collection --> str, list, tuple, set, dict

        this Operator is used to check if a value is a member of a collection or not
        if it is present in that collection it will return True
        else it will return False

        in dict we can't access the values, we can access the keys only

not in
----------
    val not in collection
        if val is not present in collection it return True
        if present it return False


7) Identity Op.
------------------
identify op. are of 2 types

    is
    is not

    is 
    -------
    this Operator compares two objects if both are same then it will return true
    otherwse False
    Synatx: val1 is val2

    is not
    --------
    it will check if both objects are same or diffreent
    if both are same objet it will return False
    otherwse it will return true

    val1 is not val2

    identify Operator mainly used to check if a value is None or not


Control Statement
------------------
They are of 2 types
    1) Decisional Statement
    2) looping Statement

1) Decisional Statement
--------------------------
these are the Statements uhich will control the flow of execution of progam.

These are of 4 types
    1) if 
    2) if ... else...
    3) elif
    4) nested if

if Statements
---------------------
it is a type of Statement which executes some set of statemnts called true statement block(TSB)
when the constion becames true or condtion statisfied

if the constion becomes false code will not executes and directly go the next line

Syntax :
if condtion:
    TSB ( true statement block)



if ... else ....
-----------------------
it is a type of statement , which executes some set of statement if constion is ture, that statement is called TSB

if the constion is False it will execute false statement block

Syntax:
if constion:
    TSB - True statement block
else:
    False Statement Block (FSB)

elif
-------------
it is a type of statement, which will check n number of conditions
if any condtion becames true, it will execute the TSB(True statement Block) of that condition
and it will exit the statement without checking following condtions

if condition is false controller will go the next condtion and if it is true, it will execute the TSB then it will exit the statement

if all the conditions are Fasle then it will execute the default False Statement


Syntax:

if condtion 1:
    TSB 1
elif condtion 2:
    TSB 2
.
.
.

elif condition n:
    TSB n
else:
    FSB

we have to start with if and else is optional here.

nested if
-------------
An if condition inside another if constion is called nested if

we use this to break the huge or big condition to small condition

Syntax:

if outer_condition 1:
    if inner_constion 1:
        TSB
    else:
        FSB
else:
    if inner_constion 1:
        TSB
    else:
        FSB

looping
--------
looping is used to iterate over collection. (visiting all elemnts 1 by 1)
we can execute a block of code n number of tme using Looping.

There are two types of looping
    while
    for

while looping
--------------
while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition
satisfies. when the condtion becomes false it execute the next line.

initialization
while condtion:
    statements
    updation - increament / decrement


Note - if we are unbale to make this condition False, we will get infinite loop
i.e. The loop  will continue for infinite times.

ex:  printt all numbers from 1 to 10 incuding 10.

n = 1

while n <= 10:
    print(n)
    n = n + 1


break
continue
pass

break statement
----------------
it is used to break the loop and send back to main space
this statemnt is only written inside a loop
it is used to break the loop

continue statement
-----------------------
It will end the current iteration 
it will excute the next iteration

pass
-------
pass is uswd as a placeholder for future code
when the pass statement is excuted nothing happens, but it helps to avoid getting empty code error
it defines empty code block


For Loop 
------------
when we know the exact number of iteration we will go with for loop
we uuse in Operator to get the  values

for val in collection:
    statement 1
    statement 2
    statement n

range()
------------
by using range() we can iterate all the numbers
it will return a range objects

+ve updation
range(start, end + 1, 1)

-ve updation
range(start, end - 1, -1)

Nested loop
------------
Executing one loop inside another loop
    Nested For
    ----------------
    Syntax :

    for val in collection:
        for val2 in collection2:
            statement 1
            statement 2

        outer statement 1
        outer statement 2

    Nested while

    

enumerate()
------------
It is a built in function
    for a ordered collection it will return index and values
    Syntax:
    for i, v in enumerate(collection):
        print(i, v)

zip()
-------
It is an inbuiltfuction 
it will takwe 2 collection with same lengh or it will slice to it to smallest len collection

it will return collection tuples

zip(collection1, collection2)
